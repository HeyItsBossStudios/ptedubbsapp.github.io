<b>The Fox and the Buffalo</b>
<hr color="black">
<p>Once upon a time,  there was a fox and a buffalo. The buffalo was very hungry and went out to go find some food.  When he steped outside his cave he saw a fox,  he said to the fox "hello Mr. Fox, would you like to go out hunting with me? ".  The fox shook his head "no you are too big to hunt,  anything you hunt will see you a mile away".  The buffalo,  very upset from this statement replied to the fox "I can sneak up on anything" the fox laughed and said "you couldn't even hide from a bat".  The buffalo very offended by this said "I bet you that I.. A very large buffalo,  can sneak up on you and scare you".  The fox didn't take any time to think. "Deal!" And the bet wss set.  The buffalo would sneak up on the fox and scare him. About a week passed,  and the buffalo was planning his big scare where as the fox was very confident that the buffalo would not be able to scare him in a million years.  That very next day the buffalo walked up on a sleeping fox and pressed his hoof on his shoulder,  the fox jumped up like a scared cat.  The buffalo laughed, "I told you I could scare you".  The fox responded with an angry "well played" and with that the fox went back to sleep and the buffalo went back home.  From then on the fox never underestimated the buffalo again.
